## üîÑ PROGRESS TRACKING

### **Weekly Milestones**
- **Week 1:** Complete Phase 1 (Lovable Restructuring)
- **Week 2:** Complete Phase 2 (PayloadCMS Schema)  
- **Week 3:** Complete Phase 3 (API Integration)
- **Week 4:** Complete Phase 4 (Testing & Deployment)

### **Current Status:** 
- **Active Phase:** Phase 2 - PayloadCMS Schema Design  
- **Next Milestone:** USER ACTION: Configure Collections in PayloadCMS admin
- **Completed:** Full API integration architecture, section components, schema design
- **Blockers:** Need access to PayloadCMS admin panel to configure collections

---

## üìã NOTES & DECISIONS

### **Technical Decisions Made:**
1. ‚úÖ Use REST API integration (not database direct access)
2. ‚úÖ Maintain existing Lovable deployment pipeline  
3. ‚úÖ Use React Query for data fetching and caching
4. ‚úÖ Implement TypeScript types from PayloadCMS schema

### **Future Considerations:**
- Consider GraphQL if REST API proves insufficient
- Plan for content versioning and previews
- Consider implementing search functionality
- Plan for multi-language support if needed
