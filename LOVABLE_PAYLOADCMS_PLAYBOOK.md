- [ ] PayloadCMS deployed on Railway.com with PostgreSQL
- [ ] GitHub repository connected to Railway for auto-deployment
- [ ] Basic understanding of React and TypeScript

### **Tools Needed:**

- Terminal access
- GitHub account
- Railway.com account

---

## 📝 STEP-BY-STEP PROMPTS

### **PROMPT 1: PROJECT ANALYSIS & PLANNING**

```
I have a Lovable website and PayloadCMS already deployed separately on Railway.com with PostgreSQL. I want to connect them so I can manage page content through PayloadCMS while keeping the existing design from Lovable.

My tech stack:
- Frontend: Lovable React SPA (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
- CMS: PayloadCMS 3.0 
- Database: PostgreSQL (shared)
- Hosting: Railway.com (both deployed separately)
- Repository: GitHub

Please analyze my current codebase structure and create a comprehensive plan for integration. Focus on:
1. Creating a clean component architecture
2. Setting up API integration between Lovable and PayloadCMS
3. Maintaining existing design while making content dynamic
4. Creating a step-by-step implementation plan

Create a project backlog with tracking system for progress management.
```

### **PROMPT 2: DATA EXTRACTION & ARCHITECTURE**

```
Now let's start implementing. First, I want to restructure my Lovable website to prepare for PayloadCMS integration.

Please:
1. Analyze my existing pages (Homepage, Pricing, etc.) and identify hardcoded content
2. Extract all data entities (services, testimonials, team members, etc.) into separate TypeScript files with proper interfaces
3. Create a clean src/data/ structure with centralized exports
4. Update components to import from the extracted data files
5. Ensure no visual regressions occur

Create reusable data structures that will map perfectly to PayloadCMS collections later.
```

### **PROMPT 3: SECTION COMPONENT CREATION**

```
Next, let's create reusable section components from the existing page structure.

Please:
1. Create a src/components/sections/ directory
2. Extract the Hero section into a reusable HeroSection component with props interface
3. Make the component flexible with customizable content while maintaining the exact visual design
4. Update the Homepage to use the new HeroSection component
5. Test that everything builds and renders correctly

This establishes the pattern for all other sections we'll create.
```

### **PROMPT 4: PAYLOADCMS API INTEGRATION SETUP**

```
Now let's set up the complete PayloadCMS API integration infrastructure.

Please create:
1. src/types/payload.ts - Complete TypeScript interfaces matching PayloadCMS schema
2. src/services/payloadApi.ts - Full REST API client with error handling
3. src/hooks/usePayload.ts - React Query hooks for data fetching with caching
4. Environment configuration for API URLs
5. Error handling with graceful fallbacks to local data

The system should work with or without PayloadCMS being available.
```

### **PROMPT 5: PAYLOADCMS SCHEMA DESIGN**

```
Design the complete PayloadCMS schema based on our extracted data structure.

Create detailed schemas for:
1. Collections: Services, Features, TeamMembers, Testimonials, Ingredients
2. Globals: Header navigation, Footer content
3. Blocks: Reusable page sections (Hero, Services, Features, etc.)
4. Pages: Flexible page composition using blocks

Provide exact field configurations, validation rules, and admin interface settings. Include sample data for testing.
```

### **PROMPT 6: SECTION COMPONENTS WITH PAYLOADCMS**

```
Create additional section components with PayloadCMS integration.

Please build:
1. ServicesSection component with PayloadCMS data fetching
2. FeaturesSection component with icon mapping and PayloadCMS integration
3. Update Homepage to use these new components
4. Add usePayloadData prop to enable/disable PayloadCMS data source
5. Implement loading states and error handling

Components should gracefully fall back to local data if PayloadCMS is unavailable.
```

### **PROMPT 7: COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION**

```
Create comprehensive documentation for the next steps.

Please provide:
1. Exact PayloadCMS collection configuration steps
2. Sample content to populate collections
3. Environment variable setup instructions
4. Testing and validation procedures
5. Troubleshooting guide for common issues

Include all code snippets and configuration details needed to complete the integration.
